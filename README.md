#  A Neural Network Machine Translation

### The fourth project for the [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101)


In this project we built a sequence to sequence model to translate sentences from English to French using a dataset of English and French sentences.

The project was implemented in Python and using Numby and Tensorflow.

#### Topics covered are:

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Sequence to Sequence models
- TensorFlow
